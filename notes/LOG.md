## 2026-10-20 — KV rent-or-buy pilot (direction #2): kill criterion met in small-context model
**Question:** When an agent pauses for a tool call, how close do distribution-based (Continuum-style TTL) and prediction-free (ski-rental) KV retention policies get to a clairvoyant per-call oracle, in-distribution and under tool-latency shift?
**Setup:** `configs/kvrent_pilot.yaml` on branch `pilot/kvrent` (code commit 2f15a3b; the sweep ran from a dirty tree based on 1565403, which is recorded in meta.json). Seeds 0–4, discrete-event simulation, 2 h simulated horizon, 1125 runs, 85 s wall on the M3 Max CPU. Costs are assumed A100-class numbers, not measurements. Results are in `results/kvrent_pilot/20261020-221854/` (`summary.csv`, `fig1_latency_vs_util_default.pdf`, `fig2_ratio_to_oracle_shift.pdf`).
**Result:** With η=4, below overload, the mean latency ratio to the oracle was:
- CONTINUUM_TTL: 1.002–1.004
- SKI_DET: 1.000
- SKI_RAND: 1.005–1.009
- ALWAYS_DISCARD: ~1.08–1.11
- ALWAYS_SWAP: 1.03–1.31

These ranges hold across the default, heavy-tail and shift mixes. Policies differ by more than 5% only in overload (λ=0.40) or at η=1, where seed-to-seed CIs are huge (e.g., ALWAYS_HOLD 9.57 ± 13.8). Sustained ALWAYS_HOLD utilization above ~85% was not reachable, because the system collapses through hold-and-wait.
**Verified vs. not:**
- Verified: 22 tests pass (the implementer's report), and the summary numbers come from `summary.csv`.
- Not verified: whether the model represents coding agents. Contexts are small (median 2k-token initial context), and running calls reserve most memory. Swap is always cheaper than discard under these costs. The shift test barely stresses per-tool CDFs. Rent is endogenous, and η is only a proxy for it.
**Interpretation:** Under this model, retention policy barely matters, so there is no headroom for a new policy. The pre-stated kill criterion (TTL within 5% of the oracle) is met. This is a negative result for the pilot model, not proof that the problem is solved in production, where held KV of 50–100k-token agent contexts could dominate memory. Even so, the area is crowded (Continuum, MORI, TokenCake), so it is deprioritized.
**Next:** Drop direction #2 unless the new direction search finds a sharp phenomenon in this space.
