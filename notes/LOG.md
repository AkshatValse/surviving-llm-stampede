## 2026-10-20 — KV rent-or-buy pilot (direction #2): kill criterion met in small-context model
**Question:** When an agent pauses for a tool call, how close do distribution-based (Continuum-style TTL) and prediction-free (ski-rental) KV retention policies get to a clairvoyant per-call oracle, in-distribution and under tool-latency shift?
**Setup:** `configs/kvrent_pilot.yaml` on branch `pilot/kvrent` (code commit 2f15a3b; the sweep ran from a dirty tree based on 1565403, which is recorded in meta.json). Seeds 0–4, discrete-event simulation, 2 h simulated horizon, 1125 runs, 85 s wall on the M3 Max CPU. Costs are assumed A100-class numbers, not measurements. Results are in `results/kvrent_pilot/20261020-221854/` (`summary.csv`, `fig1_latency_vs_util_default.pdf`, `fig2_ratio_to_oracle_shift.pdf`).
**Result:** With η=4, below overload, the mean latency ratio to the oracle was:
- CONTINUUM_TTL: 1.002–1.004
- SKI_DET: 1.000
- SKI_RAND: 1.005–1.009
- ALWAYS_DISCARD: ~1.08–1.11
- ALWAYS_SWAP: 1.03–1.31

These ranges hold across the default, heavy-tail and shift mixes. Policies differ by more than 5% only in overload (λ=0.40) or at η=1, where seed-to-seed CIs are huge (e.g., ALWAYS_HOLD 9.57 ± 13.8). Sustained ALWAYS_HOLD utilization above ~85% was not reachable, because the system collapses through hold-and-wait.
**Verified vs. not:**
- Verified: 22 tests pass (the implementer's report), and the summary numbers come from `summary.csv`.
- Not verified: whether the model represents coding agents. Contexts are small (median 2k-token initial context), and running calls reserve most memory. Swap is always cheaper than discard under these costs. The shift test barely stresses per-tool CDFs. Rent is endogenous, and η is only a proxy for it.
**Interpretation:** Under this model, retention policy barely matters, so there is no headroom for a new policy. The pre-stated kill criterion (TTL within 5% of the oracle) is met. This is a negative result for the pilot model, not proof that the problem is solved in production, where held KV of 50–100k-token agent contexts could dominate memory. Even so, the area is crowded (Continuum, MORI, TokenCake), so it is deprioritized.
**Next:** Drop direction #2 unless the new direction search finds a sharp phenomenon in this space.

## 2026-10-20 — VAT pilot (direction #1): candidate set mis-designed; strong candidate×process variance found
**Question:** How much does noisy benchmarking inflate select-the-best speedups, and does CS-racing control false improvements at lower cost than fixed repetitions?
**Setup:** Branch `pilot/vat` (commit 30e09bc). Collection used `configs/vat_pilot.yaml`: 48 Numba 5-point-stencil candidates plus a NumPy baseline, N=2048, iters=4, 6 fresh processes × 60 paired interleaved blocks per candidate, NUMBA_NUM_THREADS=4, ~45 min on the M3 Max CPU while the machine was shared with other processes. Results are in `results/vat_collect/20261020-221946/`, `results/vat_analyze/20261020-233930/`, and `results/vat_analyze_clip16/20261020-234012/`.
**Result:**
- **(a) Protocol comparison is uninformative.** The candidate family has huge effects: 14 candidates sit at or above the +300% clip, and 12 are 55–75% slower. Clipping at log 4 therefore dominates the "inflation" numbers. NAIVE FWER was 0.84, 0.73 and 0.43 at r = 3, 10 and 40. BONF-T was ≤0.05. CS-RACE at α/48 on a 2.77-wide log range accepted nothing before 40 blocks per candidate, so it saved nothing.
- **(b) Main finding: variance components of the *paired* log-ratio** (my re-analysis, one-way random effects, unclipped):
  - Serial column-major tiled candidates (t16/t32/t64) have between-process SD 0.12–0.19 in log units and ICC 0.69–0.87. Their process-mean range is 0.29–0.42, i.e. a 35–52% swing in measured speedup depending on the process.
  - Serial row-major candidates have between-process SD 0.00–0.03.
  - By comparison, the naive within-process SE of the mean for one candidate is ~0.004, so in-session CIs would be up to ~45× too narrow for these candidates.
  - Baseline median time was 57–58 ms in processes 0–4 and 64.8 ms in process 5, which is machine-state drift.
**Verified vs. not:**
- Verified: the variance decomposition was computed directly from `timings.parquet`, and the 5 tests pass (implementer's report).
- Not verified:
  - The cause of the process effect. Hypotheses are power-of-two grid aliasing that depends on allocation address, or time-varying load from other sessions, since the processes ran sequentially.
  - The PrPl-EB implementation has not been checked against the paper's code.
  - The CS validity assumption is violated by construction (process effects).
**Interpretation:**
- The planned headline, "CS-racing saves time," is not supported by this pilot. That is mostly a design flaw: effect sizes are unrealistic and the bounded-range CS is very conservative.
- The pilot did surface a sharper phenomenon. Paired, interleaved, randomized in-session measurement does **not** remove candidate×process interaction. For some kernels the between-process variance dwarfs the within-process variance.
- Any in-session test, sequential or not, then certifies process luck. For sequential tests the false-certification probability rises toward 1/2 per null candidate, and toward $1-2^{-K}$ across K null candidates, as samples accumulate.
**Next:** A placement-offset mechanism test (`experiments/vat_alignment.py`, running now). If placement explains the effect, cheap within-session re-randomization of placement could restore validity. Then decide between this and the new direction-search workflow.
